The provided JavaScript file `dataFetcher.js` contains several functions related to fetching and managing data related to dataflows and categories. Here's a breakdown of each function and its purpose based on the comments and function names:

**Cache and Data Retrieval**

* `getJSONDataCache(url, purge)`: This function retrieves JSON data from the cache or fetches it from the network and stores it in the cache. It takes a URL and an optional `purge` flag (defaults to `false`). If `purge` is true, it forces a fetch from the network even if the data exists in the cache.

**SDMX Request Builder**

* `sdmxRequestQueryBuilder(p)`: This function constructs a URL for making an SDMX request based on provided parameters. It takes an object with properties like `type` (dataflow, categoryscheme, etc.), `agency`, `id`, `references`, and `detail`.

**Data Acquisition**

* `acquireArtefactsCollection(dfId)`: This function retrieves the artifacts collection for a given dataflow ID. It constructs a URL using `sdmxRequestQueryBuilder` and then uses helper functions from `dataParser.js` to acquire and process the data.
* `requestConstraintsData(dfId)`: This function makes an asynchronous request to acquire constraints data for a specific dataflow ID. It constructs a URL and uses a function from `dataParser.js` to acquire the data.
* `requestCategorySchemeData()`: This function retrieves category scheme data using `sdmxRequestQueryBuilder` for a specific agency and ID with all references included.

**Dataflow Matching**

* `getDataflowIdsMatchingFormValues(formValuesMap)`: This function retrieves dataflow IDs that match form values provided in a map. It checks the cache for existing data, constructs a URL for data categorization, retrieves and processes data, and returns a list of matching dataflow IDs.

**Helper Functions**

* `getLinkById(data, id)` and `getDfIdByDfUrn(dfUrn)`: These are helper functions used internally by other functions to find specific information within retrieved data structures.
* `getCategorySchemeData()`: This function fetches category scheme data for all categories with parent relationships.

**Data Storage and Management**

* `fetchAndFilterArtefactsCollection(dfIdsFilteredList)`: This function retrieves a limited artefacts collection based on provided data flow IDs. It checks the cache for existing data, fetches data for missing IDs if necessary, and then filters the collection based on the provided IDs.
* `setConstraintsCollection(dfIds, purge)`: This function sets the constraints collection based on the given dataflow IDs. It checks the cache for existing data, filters based on `dfIds` if not purged, otherwise fetches new data and stores it in the cache.

Overall, this JavaScript file provides a set of functions for fetching, processing, and managing data related to dataflows, categories, and constraints. It utilizes caching mechanisms and helper functions to optimize data retrieval and processing.

**sdmxRequestQueryBuilder Function**

This function constructs URLs for SDMX requests based on provided parameters. Here are the query parameters it uses:

* `format`: Set to `"sdmx-json"` to specify the response format.
* `references`: Included if the `p.references` property is provided in the function arguments. This specifies references to include in the request.
* `detail`: Included if the `p.detail` property is provided in the function arguments. This specifies the level of detail for the data.

**Functions Using sdmxRequestQueryBuilder**

Several functions in the file utilize `sdmxRequestQueryBuilder` to construct URLs. Here's a breakdown of the query parameters used by each function:

* `acquireArtefactsCollection(dfId)`:
    * `type`: Set to `"dataflow"`.
    * `id`: Set to the provided `dfId` argument.
    * `references`: Set to `"all"` to include all references.
* `requestConstraintsData(dfId)`:
    * `type`: Set to `"dataflow"`.
    * `id`: Set to the provided `dfId` argument.
    * `references`: Set to `"ancestors"` to include ancestor references.
* `requestCategorySchemeData()`:
    * `type`: Set to `"categoryscheme"`.
    * `agency`: Set to `"ESTAT"`.
    * `id`: Set to `"MICRODATA_DOMAINS"`.
    * `references`: Set to `"all"` to include all references.
* `getDataflowIdsMatchingFormValues(formValuesMap)`:
    * `type`: Set to `"categorisation"`.
    * `id`: Set to `"all"`.
    * `references`: Set to `"ancestors"` to include ancestor references.
* `getCategorySchemeData()`:
    * `type`: Set to `"categoryscheme"`.
    * `id`: Set to `"all"`.
    * `references`: Set to `"parents"` to include parent references.

Sure, let's break down the structure of the provided `dataFetcher` module:

1. **Imports**: The module imports functions and constants from other modules, including `dataParser.js`, `sessionStorageKeys.js`, and `utils.js`. These imported functions and constants are used within the module's functions.

2. **Function Declarations**:
   - **`getJSONDataCache`**: Retrieves JSON data from cache or fetches it from the network. It includes error handling to ensure that the fetched data contains a "data" property.
   - **`sdmxRequestQueryBuilder`**: Constructs a URL for making an SDMX request based on provided parameters.
   - **`acquireArtefactsCollection`**: Retrieves the artifacts collection for a given dataflow ID.
   - **`requestConstraintsData`**: Makes an asynchronous request to acquire constraints data for a given dataflow ID.
   - **`requestCategorySchemeData`**: Requests category scheme data from a specific URL using the SDMX request query builder.
   - **`getDataflowIdsMatchingFormValues`**: Retrieves dataflow IDs that match form values provided in the `formValuesMap`.
   - **`getCategorySchemeData`**: Asynchronously fetches category scheme data from a specified URL using the SDMX request builder.
   - **`fetchAndFilterArtefactsCollection`**: Retrieves a limited artifacts collection based on provided data flow IDs, filtering the collection.
   - **`setConstraintsCollection`**: Sets constraints collection based on given data flow IDs, with an option to purge existing collection.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - **`getLinkById`**: Retrieves a link from a data array based on the provided ID.
   - **`getDfIdByDfUrn`**: Retrieves a data flow ID from a data array based on the provided data flow URN.

4. **Exported Functions**: All functions are exported from the module, making them accessible for use in other modules.

5. **Error Handling**: The `getJSONDataCache` function includes error handling to throw an error if the fetched data does not contain the expected "data" property.

6. **Asynchronous Operations**: Several functions use asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching data from an API) and return promises.

7. **Caching**: The `getJSONDataCache` function includes logic to cache fetched data and to optionally force a fetch from the network.

8. **Session Storage**: Some functions utilize session storage to store and retrieve data.

Overall, the `dataFetcher` module is structured to provide a set of functions for fetching, processing, and manipulating JSON data related to statistical data and metadata from an SDMX-compliant API. It follows a modular approach, with each function serving a specific purpose and relying on helper functions and imported modules for additional functionality.
